
Thank you for trying VisualTail, your new tool to watch at files.

If you want to run the application, no matter the operating system you are, double click the VisualTail.jar.
If you don't see anything, open a console/terminal and type "java -jar VisualTail.jar" to check the messages printed by the application.

IMPORTANT: You are not going to execute this tool without the Java runtime (JRE) v1.7 (or higher) installed. Visit http://java.sun.com to start downloading the required Java software.
